About the game
--------
The game is based on an old time pacman game.
It's based on client-server model.
The player inserts the location of the pacman, and the server calculates the locations of all the other components 
on the board by it's own algorithm, and sends back the information to the client.

How to play

The player import a CSV file, insert the location of the Pacman and then choose how he wants to play. 

There are three options:
### Normal

The user clicks on a point and the pacman start moving towords the direction of the click.
### Step by step

### Automatic
The automatic algo calculates the route of the pacman, and the game is played automatic.
The player can choose weather to insert the pacman, or let the algorithm choose the start point of the pacman.
